# information-bottleneck
Implemented Bayesian Neural Networks using Langevin Dynamics to visualize epistemic uncertainty in out-of-distribution regions. Then, I analyzed the Information Bottleneck Principle, tracking the compression of mutual information I(X;T) during the training dynamics of stochastic networks
